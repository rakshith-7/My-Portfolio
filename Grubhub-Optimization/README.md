# Grubhub Optimization Project

## Project Overview
The Grubhub Optimization Project was undertaken as part of Protothon 5.0, where our team focused on solving critical problems faced by Grubhub drivers to enhance their efficiency and satisfaction. The project aimed to improve route optimization, tip visibility, and overall driver experience using advanced technologies like AI.

## Methodology
The project followed a structured approach:
1. **Falling in Love with the Problem:** We deeply analyzed the core issues faced by Grubhub drivers by leveraging the Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework.
2. **Competitive Analysis:** We evaluated Grubhub's competitive landscape to identify key differentiators and areas for improvement.
3. **User Persona Development:** Created detailed user personas to understand the needs and frustrations of different driver segments.
4. **Pain Points Identification:** Conducted user interviews and surveys to pinpoint specific pain points.
5. **Market Sizing:** Analyzed the market to understand the total addressable market (TAM), serviceable available market (SAM), and the target market.
6. **Building the MVP:** Developed a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) using Figma to prototype solutions for the identified problems.
7. **Understanding Metrics:** Defined key metrics to measure the success of our solutions, including Northstar metrics, counter metrics, and success metrics.
8. **Prioritization:** Used various prioritization frameworks to determine the most impactful features to develop and deploy.

## Outcomes
- **Top 5 out of 100 Teams:** Our project was recognized among the top 5 projects out of 100 participating teams.
- **Prototype Development:** Created a functional prototype using Figma to demonstrate the proposed solutions.
- **Validated Solutions:** Conducted thorough validation of our ideas, ensuring alignment with driver needs and market demands.
